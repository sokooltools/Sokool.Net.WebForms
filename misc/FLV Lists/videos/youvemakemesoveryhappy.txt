I've lost and loved before 
Got mad and closed the door 
But you said: "Try just once more" 

I chose you for the one 
Now I'm havin' so much fun 
You treated me so kind 
I'm about to lose my mind 

You've made me so very happy 
I'm so glad you came into my life 

The others were untrue 
But when it came to lovin' you 
I'd spend my whole life with you 

'Cause you came and you took control 
You touched my very soul 
You always showed me that 
Lovin' you is where it's at 

You've made me so very happy 
I'm so glad you came into my life 

Yeaheaheah 

I love you so much it seems 
You're even in my dreams 
I can hear 
Babe, I can hear you calling me 

I'm so in love with you 
All I ever want to do is 
Thank you, baby 
Thank you, baby 

You've made me so very happy 
I'm so glad you came into my life 

You've made me so very happy 
You've made me so, so very happy, baby 
I'm so glad you came into my life 

Mmm, I wanna thank you, girl 
Every day of my life 
I wanna thank you 

You made me so very happy 
Oh, I wanna spend my life with you 
Thank you, baby 
Thank you 

Thank you, baby 
Thank you
