Can't Get Enough of Your Love
(spoken)
I've heard people say that
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
Oh no
But I dont know about that
Theres many times that we've loved
We've shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me like its enough
There's just not enough of it
There's just not enough
Oh oh, babe

(sung)
My darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
Cant get enough of your love babe
Oh, some things I cant get used to
No matter how I try
Just like the more you give, the more I want
And baby, that's no lie
Oh no, babe

Tell me, what can I say?
What am I gonna do?
How should I feel when everything is you?
What kind of love is this that you're givin me?
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?

Girl, all I know is every time you're here
I feel the change
Somethin moves
I scream your name
Do whatcha got to do (?)

Darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Girl, I dont know, I don't know, I don't know why
I cant get enough of your love babe
Oh no, babe

Girl, if I could only make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand
Oh well, babe

How can I explain all the things I feel?
Youve given me so much
Girl, you're so unreal
Still I keep loving you
More and more each time
Girl, what am I gonna do
Because you blow my mind

I get the same old feel'in every time youre here
I feel the change
Somethin moves
I scream your name
Do whatcha got to do (?)

Darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh no, babe

(spoken)
Baby, let me take all of my life to find you
But you can believe its gonna take the rest of my life to keep you

(sung)
Oh no, babe
My darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Yeah, I don't know, I dont know, I dont know why
Cant get enough of your love babe
Oh my darling, I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh babe
I don't know, I dont know, I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh babe
