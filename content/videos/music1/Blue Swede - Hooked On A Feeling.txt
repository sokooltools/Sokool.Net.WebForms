oonga Chaka Oonga Oonga! ....

I can't stop this feeling
Deep inside of me.
Girl, you just don't realize
What you do to me.
When you hold me
In your arms so tight,
You let me know,
Everything's alright, ahahah

I'mmmmm hooked on a feeling,
I'm high on believing,
That you're in love with me.

Lips as sweet as candy.
Its taste stays on my mind.
Girl, you got me thirsty for another cup of wine.

Got a bug from you girl,
But I don't need no cure,
I'll just stay a victim, If I can for sure 
All the good love, when we're all alone
Keep it up girl, yeah you turn me on.

I'mmm, Hooked on a feeling.
I'm high on believing, that you're in love with me. 
All the good love, [ooga chaka ooga ooga ...] when we're all alone
Keep it up girl, yeah you turn me on.

I'mmmm hooked on a feeling,
I'm high on believing,
That your in love with me.

I'm hooked on a feeling,
I'm high on believing,
That your in love with me.

I said I'm hooked on a feeling,
And I'm high on believing,
That your in love with me.
