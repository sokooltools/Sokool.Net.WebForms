I saw her sitting in the rain
raindrops falling on her
she didnt seem to care,
she sat there and smiled at me

Then I knew
(I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew)
she could make me happy
(happy, happy...she could make me very happy)
Flowers in her hair, Flowers everywhere

(chorus):
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
oh I dont know just why
she simply caught my eye
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
she seems so sweet and kind
she crept into in my mind
(to my, to my mind)

I knew I had to say hello
(hello, hello)
She smiled up at me
Then she took my hand
and we walk in the park alone

Then I knew
(I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew)
she had made me happy
(happy, happy...she had made me very happy)
flowers in her hair
flowers everywhere

(chorus)

Suddenly the sun broke through
(see the sun)
I turned around, she was gone
(where did she go)
and all I had left, was one little flower in my hair

But I knew
(I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew)
she had made me happy
(happy, happy...she had made me very happy)
Flowers in her hair, Flowers everywhere

I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
was she reality or just a dream to me
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
well love showd me the way to find a sunny day
(sunny day, sunny day, sunny day)

I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
was she reality or just a dream to me

Fade
