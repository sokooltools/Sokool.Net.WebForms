Is there anybody gone to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
Shes the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry;
Still, you dont regret a single day.
Ah girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool.
Didididi..
When you say shes looking good
She acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool,
Girl! Girl! [Was she]

When I think of all the times Ive tried to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her.
After all this times I dont know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

Shes the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say shes looking good, she acts as if its understood.
Shes cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!

Was she told when she was young the pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when hes dead?
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!
