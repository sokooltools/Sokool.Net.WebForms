PHANTOMS VOICE
Christine

MEG
Where in the world
have you been hiding?
Really, you were
perfect!
I only wish
I knew your secret!
Who is your great
tutor?

CHRISTINE (gazing trance-like around the Chapelle)
Father once spoke
of an angel . . .
I used to dream hed
appear . . .
Now as I sing,
I can sense him . . .
And I know
hes here . . .
Here in this room
he calls me softly . . .
somewhere inside . . .
hiding . . .
Somehow I know
hes always with me . . .
he - the unseen
genius . . .

MEG
Christine, you must have
been dreaming . . .
stories like this cant
come true . . .
Christine, youre talking
in riddles . . .
and its not
like you . . .

CHRISTINE
Angel of Music!
Guide
and guardian!
Grant to me your
glory!

MEG (to herself)
Who is this angel?
This . . .

BOTH
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Secret and strange
angel . . .

CHRISTINE
Hes with me, even now . . .

MEG
Your hands are cold . . .

CHRISTINE
All around me . . .

MEG
Your face, Christine,
its white . . .

CHRISTINE
It frightens me . . .

MEG
Dont be frightened . . .
