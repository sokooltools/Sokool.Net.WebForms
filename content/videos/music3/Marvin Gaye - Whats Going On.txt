Mother, mother
Theres too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
Theres far too many of you dying
You know weve got to find a way
To bring some lovin here today - Ya

Father, father
We dont need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know weve got to find a way
To bring some lovin here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Dont punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
Oh, whats going on
Whats going on
Ya, whats going on
Ah, whats going on

In the mean time
Right on, baby
Right on
Right on

Mother, Mother, everybody thinks were wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh, you know weve got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Oh

Picket lines and picket signs
Dont punish me with brutality
Talk to me
So you can see
Whats going on
Ya, whats going on
Tell me whats going on
Ill tell you whats going on - Uh
Right on baby
Right on baby
